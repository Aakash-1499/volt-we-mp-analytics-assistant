mp_analytics_core.fact_operators_mp_events

**Owner:** Aakash / Mohit

**Grain:** Operator_code, event_date

**Short description:** This table captures daily activity summary of the operators from landing to trip. Eg. # of loads checked, # of bids placed / # of tokens paid / # of completed trips, plus lifetime cumulative metrics (life_time_trips, plc_till_date) and dimensions like fleet_size, fo_segment, fo_sub_type. Used for FO daily activation, engagement funnel, and supply-side cohort analysis.

## 7_fact_demand_opsearch_operator_summary

mp_analytics_core.fact_demand_opsearch_operator_summary

**Owner:** Gajinder

**Grain:** demand_id, operator_code

**Short description:** Stores the output of the opsearch model at demand × operator grain. The model determines probability of each operator within 120km of demand origin fulfilling it. Only saves top operators (predetermined count). Used to evaluate per-operator supply probability and notification eligibility.

**Short description:** Demand-level receivables and collection table for the consigner business. One row per demand carrying the trip milestone timestamps (GTL, loading, in-transit, unloading, trip end, POD, invoice), the billing terms (payment mode, payment plan, billing date, due date), the receivable build-up (freight fare, GST, payment mode fee, discount, delay amount, TDS, settlements) and the full recovery curve - how much was recovered within due date and then within 3/5/7/15/30/45/60/90/120/150/180/240 days. Also carries the NPA position (gross and net), DSO, credit cost, and the cost of recovery effort split across sales, central and legal teams. This is the table to use for DSO, NPA, ageing and collection-efficiency reporting.
